While opening the Android device in Appium Studio,
if pop-up blink for a second and disappear
Check the Error log of Android Studio
Navigate to Help--->>>Open Log Folder
Open the latest log file and see the issue......
Most probably,that is a permission issue and 
an error with error code-13 will be present and a path of folder

modify the below command with the new path that you find in the log file

sudo chmod +x /Applications/AppiumStudio/bin/adb/adb
